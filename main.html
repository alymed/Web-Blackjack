        <h3>How to play?</h3>
        <p2>Blackjack is a popular card game where the objective is to beat the dealer by having a hand value as close
            to 21 as possible without exceeding it. Players are dealt two cards and can choose to "hit" (take another
            card) or "stand" (keep their current hand). Aces can be worth 1 or 11, and face cards are worth 10. The best
            possible hand is an Ace and a 10-point card (10, Jack, Queen, or King) and is called a "blackjack." If a
            player's hand exceeds 21, they "bust" and lose. The dealer follows specific rules, and the player with a
            hand value closest to 21 without going over wins the round.</p2>
